Get started by creating a new file or uploading an existing file. We recommend every repository include a README, LICENSE, and .gitignore.

â€¦or create a new repository on the command line

echo "# myrepo" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/loretoparisi/myrepo.git
git push -u origin master
